My high school project. Made to demonstrate weaknesses in the Swedish equivalent of the SAT, "HÃ¶gskoleprovet", with a fully functioning cheat.

Requirements to execute the cheat:

1. 2 phones
2. 2 persons who can write the test
3. 2 PingaOculto spy earpieces or equivalent
4. Something to run the server on

How it works:
The individuals executing the cheat divide the test equally (50/50). At the 45-minute mark, both of the test-takers get the letters "A,B,C,D,E" 
sequentially communicated to them trough the earpieces. When the letter corresponding to the writers answer plays, they move the phone taped 
to their leg or elsewhere to signal the correct answer trough the phones accelerometer. This is done 20 times per test-taker, as each test 
has a total of 40 questions. Once the test-takers have submitted their answers, they are combined and sent out to the customers wearing the 
same earpieces.

Problems:
The only issue that this cheat faces currently are the metal detector tests,
although they are rare and the consequences minimal as you are not legally obliged to go trough them.
If you refuse you won't be allowed to take the test for 2 years.

Solution:
Randomise the order of questions and/or answers on parts where the order doesnt matter such as ORD, MEK, XYZ, KVA and NOG.
