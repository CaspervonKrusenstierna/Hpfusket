My high school project made to demonstrate weaknesses in the Swedish equivalent of the SAT "HÃ¶gskoleprovet" with a fully functioning cheat.

Requirements to pull the cheat off:

2 phones
2 people who can write the test
2 PingaOculto spy earpieces or equivalent


How it works:
The people who know how to write the cheat split the test up 50/50. At the 45 minute mark both of the writers get the letters "A,B,C,D,E" 
sequentially communicated to them with a pause between each letter trough the earpieces. When the letter corresponding to the writers answer 
is being played they move the phone taped to their leg or somewhere else a bit to signal their answer. Once the answers are submitted they are
appended and then sent out the customers.
