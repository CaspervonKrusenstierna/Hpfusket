My high school project. A fully functioning cheat for the Swedish equivalent of the SAT, "HÃ¶gskoleprovet". Made to demonstrate a major weakness in the current way that it's being conducted.

Requirements:
1. 2 phones
2. 2 persons who can take the test
3. 2 PingaOculto spy earpieces or equivalent
4. Something to run the server on

How it works: 
The individuals executing the cheat divide the test questions equally. At the 45-minute mark, both test-takers get the letters "A, B, C, D, E" sequentially communicated to them through the earpieces. When the letter corresponding to the writer's answer plays, they move the phone taped to their leg or elsewhere to signal it through the phone's accelerometer. This is done 20 times per test-taker, as each test has a total of 40 questions. Once the test-takers have submitted their answers, they are combined and sent out to the customers wearing the same type of earpieces.

Problems: 
The only issue that this cheat currently faces are the metal detector tests, although they are rare and the consequences
minimal as you are not legally obliged to go through them. If you refuse, you won't be allowed to take the test for 2 years.

Solution:
Randomize the order of questions and/or answers on parts where the order doesn't matter such as ORD, MEK, XYZ, KVA and NOG.
