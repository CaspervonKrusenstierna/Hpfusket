My high school project made to demonstrate weaknesses in the Swedish equivalent of the SAT "HÃ¶gskoleprovet" with a fully functioning cheat.

Requirements to pull the cheat off:

1. 2 phones
2. 2 people who can write the test
3. 2 PingaOculto spy earpieces or equivalent

How it works:
The people who know how to write the cheat split the test up 50/50. At the 45 minute mark both of the writers get the letters "A,B,C,D,E" 
sequentially communicated to them 20 times with a pause between each letter trough the earpieces. When the letter corresponding to the writers answer 
is being played they move the phone taped to their leg or somewhere else a bit to signal their answer. Once the answers are submitted they are
appended and then sent out the customers.

Problems:
The only thing that poses a problem for this method currently are the metal detector tests, 
although they are rare and the consequences are minimal as you could just refuse to go trough them.
If refuse your punishment will be that you wont be allowed to write the test for 2 years.

Solution:
Randomise the questions and/or answers on parts where the order doesnt matter such as ORD, MEK, XYZ, KVA and NOG.
